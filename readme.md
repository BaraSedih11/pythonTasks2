# Linear Algebra and Matrix Operations in Python

This repository contains Python code for performing linear algebra operations and matrix manipulations. The tasks include creating a class for products, implementing matrix multiplication, finding determinants, solving linear systems, and more.

## Task 1: Total and Average Sales Calculation

The script `sales_calculator.py` inside Task1 folder contains a Python program that calculates the total sales and average sales for a given week's sales amounts.

## Task 2: Product Class and Basket Discount

The script `product_operations.py` inside Task2 folder defines a `Product` class with attributes like name, price, and quantity. Additionally, it includes functions to calculate the total cost of a given basket of products and apply a discount.

## Task 3+4: Product Class Instance

The task involves defining a class named `Product` with attributes such as name, price, and quantity. An instance of the class is created to showcase its usage.

## Task 5: Linear Algebra Functions
The script `data_handling.py` inside Task5 folder includes functions for performing linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, finding determinants, and solving linear systems.

Feel free to explore each task's script for more details and examples.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed, then run each script individually using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python sales_calculator.py
python product_operations.py
python Product.py
python linear_algebra.py
```


## Dependencies
No external dependencies are required. The scripts use standard Python libraries.
